#Expression
##Description this stores expression data of a variety of different types (microarray, RNA-Seq, Proteomics, q-PCR)

##Data
The data is currently being stored in both the Central Store and the Workspace.  They are not dependent on one another.
However for uploading from GEO the current public data pipeline requires getting information from the Genomes and Features in the CS.

##Owner/Author
Jason Baumohl

##Workspace Module
KBaseExpression

##Workspace with Data
KBasePublicExpression

##Repo
https://github.com/kbase/expression

##Data Sources
* GEO : This is the primary source for our public data
* Private Data : Data from outside users
* RNA-Seq Data : Currently From Mike Schatz group
* Central Store : Used currently to upload the GEO data to map the data genomes and their corresponding CDS features.  Uses both direct SQL and CDMI methods.
* Ontologies : EO, PO and ENVO terms
* The plant group has added annotations for specific samples by hand for ontologies and replicate groups. They supply me with this file for uploading the GEO data.

##Dependencies
* CS (Methods need to be rewritten to remove the CS dependency and work on WS objects only).
* Workspace
* ID Server(for upload pipeline)
* Blat (for GEO uploan pipeline)

##Module: KBaseExpression

##Types
###ExpressionSeries
####Description
The Expression Series is a collection of ExpressionSamples that are linked together in some sort of study. This maps to a GEO GSE.
####Relationships
It references Genomes and ExpressionSamples (both by ws reference)
####Fields:
* id : Id of the series usually gotten from the id-server for public data
* source_id : Some string representing the source, in the case of GEO it would be the GSE ID
* genome_expression_sample_ids_map : A map in which the Genome ID is the key and the values are an array of corresponding expression samples.
* title
* summary 
* design : Design of the study
* publication_id 
* external_source_date : Date associated with the external source.

###ExpressionSample
####Description
The core expression unit.  This is the data for an individual expression experiment.  This generally maps to a GEO GSM.
####Relationships
It references Genomes, ExpressionPlatforms and ExpressionSeries (although not by WS reference)
Also has ties to Features and Ontologies.
Referenced by ReplicateGroups and ExpressionSamples
####Fields:
* id : Id of the series usually gotten from the id-server for public data
* source_id : Some string representing the source, in the case of GEO it would be the GSM ID
* type : The type of sample.  Ideally a controlled vocabulary - microarray, RNA-Seq, qPCR, or proteomics 
* numerical_interpretation : The type of numerical data stored - Currently the types are Log2 level intensities, Log2 level ratios, Log2 level ratios genomic DNA control, FPKM.  Down the line we may have on off calls.
* description
* title
* data_quality_level : integer that represents how the data was mapped to CDS features.  
  * 1 : The platform ids were resolved using a custom mappings file
  * 2 : Probe sequences were resolved using Blat   (large genomes can not be done this way)
  * 3 : The platform ids were translated using feature aliases 
* original_median : The measurements for a non FPKM sample are normalized so that their median is zero.  This field keeps the orignal median value for the sample if the people want to be able to transform the data back to the original values. 
* external_source_date : Date associated with the external source.
* expression_levels : Map of Feature IDs and their measurement
* genome_id : WS reference to a genome object.
* expression_ontology_terms : a list of ontology objects (EO, PO or ENVO).  Probabyl needs to be changed in the future once ontologies get nailed down.
* platfrom_id : A WS reference to the ExpressionPlatform object (if it exists)
* default_control_sample : currently not being used.  If you want a particular sample as the default control
* averaged_from_samples : currently not being used.  If sample was averaged from other samples, this would be a list of the other samples.
* protocol : A protocol subtype that has a name and description.
* strain : A strain subtype (genome_id, reference_strain, wild_type, description, name)
* persons : a list of people subtypes associated with this sample (email, first_name, last_name, institution)
* molecule : the type of molecule being measured. (can have different values, but typically total RNA, total RNA/total RNA or total RNA/genomic DNA)
* data_source : Typically GEO for microarray data, but could be other places.
* shock_url : A shock url to the read files for RNA-Seq experiments (added by Sri)
* processing_comments : KBase's processing comments
* expression_series_ids : A list of expression series this sample belongs (NOTE not a WS reference, the WS reference is in the other direction)
* characteristics : Free text from GEO file.
* RMA_normalized : An integer if 1 means data was RMA normalized.

###ExpressionPlatform
####Description
The platform that the experiment was run on. Generally for microarray, but potentially some instrument information for other technology types could be stored in this.  This generally maps to a GEO GPL.

##Methods
As the author of this particular repo, I am pointing out that these will need to be changed and rewritten.  Currently it is all written in Perl and acesses the data via direct SQL queries against the Central Store.Also many of the methods were geared for searching before search existed.  The search related methods will not be carried over and should be abandoned.  The current outdated methods exist here: https://github.com/kbase/expression/blob/master/lib/Bio/KBase/KBaseExpression/KBaseExpressionImpl.pm
The methonds with a * at the end are the ones that should be rewritten to work against the workspace.
